 ##Checklist##
 
 The “analysis.html” file:
 
 - [x] Includes the potential license of the dataset to be generated
 - [x] Includes the resource naming strategy
 
 The resource naming strategy:
 
 - [x] Uses a domain that is not the one given by default in Protégé
 - [x] Uses different paths for ontology resources (i.e., classes and properties) and individuals
 - [x] Ensures that the paths for individuals of different classes are not the same
 - [x] Defines property URIs independently of class URIs
 
 The ontology file:
 
 - [x] Uses the .ttl extension
 - [x] Is serialized in the Turtle format
 - [x] Follows the resource naming strategy
 - [x] Contains at least one class
 - [x] Contains at least one object property (where the value of the property is a resource)
 - [x] Contains at least one datatype property (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually typed)
 - [x] Defines the domain of all the properties (the origin of the property)
 - [x] Defines the range of all the properties (the destination of the property)
 - [x] Defines all class names starting with a capital letter
 - [x] Defines all property names starting with a non-capital letter
 - [ ] Does not mix labels in different languages (e.g., Spanish and English)
 - [x] Does not define multiple domains or multiple ranges in properties
 - [x] Contains at least one class that will be used to link to other entities
