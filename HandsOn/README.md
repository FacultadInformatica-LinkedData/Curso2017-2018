==================

This is the directory where students have to upload their materials related to the hands-on.

# Use of GitHub

* Each group designates a leader
* The leader forks the main repository
* Group members fork the leader repository

# GitHub structure

* All the hands-on materials under the “HandsOn” directory
* Each group will create a directory in github for uploading all the materials of the hands-on.
