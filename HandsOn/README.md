==================

This is the directory where students have to upload their materials related to the hands-on.

# Use of GitHub

* The leader forks the main repository
* Group members fork the leader repository

# GitHub structure

* All the hands-on materials under the “HandsOn” directory
* Each group will create a directory in github for uploading all the materials of the hands-on. 
* Group directories must follow the format "GroupXX" where "XX" is the number of the group (e.g., "Group01"). Group numbers will be created in a first come-first served basis, starting from number 1 and giving consecutive numbers.
