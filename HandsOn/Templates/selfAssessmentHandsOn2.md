#Hands-on assignment 2 – Self assessment#

##Checklist##

**The “analysis.html” file:**

- [ ] Includes the potential license of the dataset to be generated
- [ ] Includes the resource naming strategy

**The resource naming strategy:**

- [ ] Uses a domain that is not the one given by default in Protégé
- [ ] Uses different paths for ontology resources (i.e., classes and properties) and individuals
- [ ] Ensures that the paths for individuals of different classes are not the same
- [ ] Defines individual URIs independently of class URIs

**The ontology file:**

- [ ] Uses the .ttl extension
- [ ] Is serialized in the Turtle format
- [ ] Follows the resource naming strategy
- [ ] Contains at least one class
- [ ] Contains at least one object property (where the value of the property is a resource)
- [ ] Contains at least one datatype property (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually typed)
- [ ] Defines the domain of all the properties (the origin of the property)
- [ ] Defines the range of all the properties (the destination of the property)
- [ ] Defines all class names starting with a capital letter
- [ ] Defines all property names starting with a non-capital letter
- [ ] Does not mix labels in different languages (e.g., Spanish and English)
- [ ] Does not define multiple domains or multiple ranges in properties
- [ ] Contains at least one class that will be used to link to other entities
