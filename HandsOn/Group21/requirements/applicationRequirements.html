<h1>Includes a description of the application user interface</h1> 

<p>We would like to use available open datasets to develop an application (initially a web app) that helps citizens of the community of Madrid in in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p>1. - First, the user will register in our application, including name and mobile number.<br>
  2. - In case of an emergency (Earthquake, Fire, Flood, etc.), the app verifies who of our users could be in range of this alert.<br>
  3. - Sends the user a message (using SMS API), that includes a link to a generated website that has valuable open linked information, as closest police stations, fire stations, safe places and other relevant data that we can link between the available datasets.</p>
<p>Here a quick mockup on what we want to achieve:<br>
