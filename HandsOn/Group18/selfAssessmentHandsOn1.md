After we agreed on the project, we focused on the different data sources that we can use for our implementation. We kept our scope as Madrid. It took time to assess the data sources that can be helpful for future of the project. The difficult part is to understand the possible problems that we can have while using the sources as they have different formats. It is good to proceed with everything step-by-step.

*Santiago Salgado*:
Interesting first approach, as we are focusing on Madrid, I was able to understand what information is available, and what data-challenge information we might have, as not everything as we want is available as csv files.
