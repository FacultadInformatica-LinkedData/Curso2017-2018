**The resource naming strategy:**

- [x] Uses a domain that is not the one given by default in Protégé
- [x] Uses different paths for ontology resources (i.e., classes and properties) and individuals

- [x] Defines individual URIs independently of class URIs

**The ontology file:**

- [x] Uses the .ttl extension

- [x] Follows the resource naming strategy
- [x] Contains at least one class
- [x] Contains at least one object property (where the value of the property is a resource)
- [x] Contains at least one datatype property (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually typed)
- [x] Defines the domain of all the properties (the origin of the property)
- [x] Defines the range of all the properties (the destination of the property)
- [x] Defines all class names starting with a capital letter
- [x] Defines all property names starting with a non-capital letter
- [x] Does not mix labels in different languages (e.g., Spanish and English)
- [x] Does not define multiple domains or multiple ranges in properties
- [x] Contains at least one class that will be used to link to other entities
