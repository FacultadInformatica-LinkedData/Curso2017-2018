- [X] Follows the resource naming strategy
- [X] Contains at least one class
- [X] Contains at least one object property (where the value of the property is a resource)
- [X] Contains at least one datatype property (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually typed)
- [X] Defines the domain of all the properties (the origin of the property)
- [X] Defines the range of all the properties (the destination of the property)
- [X] Defines all class names starting with a capital letter
- [ ] Defines all property names starting with a non-capital letter
- [ ] Does not mix labels in different languages (e.g., Spanish and English)
