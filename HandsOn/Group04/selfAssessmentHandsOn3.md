**Every RDF file:**

- [x] Uses the .ttl extension
- [x] Is serialized in the Turtle format
- [x] Follows the resource naming strategy
- [x] Uses class and property URIs that are the same as those used in the ontology

**Every URI in the RDF files:**

- [x] Is "readable" and has some meaning (e.g., it is not an auto-increased integer)
- [x] Is not encoded as a string
- [x] Does not contain a double slash (i.e., "//")

**Every individual in the RDF files:**

- [x] Has a label with the name of the individual
- [x] Has a type
- [x] Every value in the RDF files:
- [x] Is not empty (i.e., “”)
- [x] Is trimmed
- [x] Is properly encoded (e.g., dates, booleans)
- [x] Includes its datatype
- [x] Uses the correct datatype (e.g., values of 0-1 may be booleans and not integers, not every string made of numbers is a number)
