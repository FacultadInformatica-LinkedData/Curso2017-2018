# Development of the Application by Group 11

This proyect is being developed using the Eclipse IDE and JavaFX for the GUI, using Maven for some of the dependencies.

To compile and execute the code you need to create a file in the src/resources/key.txt file and introduce your Google Maps API key in the first line without end-of-line. If you dont, the proyect will work the same but you will not be able to display the picture of the map.
