		<h1> Application Requeriments </h1>
			<p>
				The application we are going to develop will be a tool for consulting events and activities happening in the city of Madrid, giving the user the option to filter them with parameters like "Is the event free?" or "Which day of the week is it?" to show the user the events he is interested in.

			<p>In the next image we can see the provisional Mockup of how the Application would look</p>
